# Project: Motion Planning for Pick and Place Task using UR5

### Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing motion planning for a pick and place task using a UR5 robotic arm.

### Duration

January 2023 - May 2023

### Key Features

1. **RRT Algorithm**: Implemented the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm for robotic path planning.
2. **UR5 Integration**: Applied the motion planning algorithm to a UR5 robotic arm for pick-and-place tasks.

### Technical Details

- **Robot**: Universal Robots UR5 robotic arm
- **Algorithm**: Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) for path planning

### Implementation Highlights

1. **Path Planning**: Utilized RRT to generate efficient paths for the UR5 arm.
2. **Task-Specific Application**: Tailored the motion planning for pick-and-place operations.

## Future Improvements
